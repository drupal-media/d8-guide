# Contributing

The Drupal Media Team has been growing over the last few years and gradually gaining momentum. We are always looking for new team members to help moving things forward and there are many ways to get involved, including helping with funding, project management communications, documentation, testing and development.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and edit the guide in your favorite text editor or in the official [GitBook desktop app](https://www.gitbook.com/editor).
